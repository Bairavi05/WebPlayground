# WebPlayground

Welcome to **WebPlayground**! This is a collection of basic vanilla JavaScript programs designed to showcase simple and fun web applications. Currently, the repository includes three programs:

1. **Rock Paper Scissors** – A classic game where you can play against the computer. 
2. **Stopwatch** – A simple stopwatch to measure time. 
3. **Number Guessing** – A fun game where you guess a random number generated by the computer.
 
More programs and features will be added in the future, so stay tuned!
